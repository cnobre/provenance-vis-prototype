They may not be as familiar with data visualization as some of us are.,The training videos were very useful in introducing me to graph-based visualizations and social graphs so when I was given the guide and training tasks I was able to overcome the learning curve a bit more easily than if I hadn&#39;t watched the video.,7,52.28333333333333</td>

For example Helwig only interacts with Thomas. Unsurprisingly those outliers have the fewest followers and often tweets. However looking towards the centre of the diagram - where you see the most nodes you would expect to see a correlation between tweets and follows (e.g. like Robert) but that isn&#39;t always the case. Tamara MViews and EEyes have lots of tweets but not a correspondingly high number of followers. Most users tend to be from North America or Europe - there also tend to be geographical clusters. Maybe time difference and real-time interactions still have a bearing in the digital age?It also appears institutions have fewer followers overall than people.
